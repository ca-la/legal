WE MAY MODIFY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ANY TIME, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, AND SUCH MODIFICATION SHALL BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON EITHER POSTING OF THE MODIFIED PRIVACY POLICY ON THE SITE OR NOTIFYING YOU.

## Managing Your Content

CALA enables you to create, design and upload your garment and acessory design projects (“Design Projects”) through the Platform and additionally, through CALA Fit, to get fitted for great fitting clothing using only your phone. This data will be stored so that you can make future purchases without needing to go through the fitting process again. At your election, you may delete all fitting data in the menu on your Account. Should you choose to do this, you will need to go through the fitting process again prior to making a future purchase. We hope you'll enjoy the simplicity of size-free shopping for a very long time, however, if for some reason you ever want to delete your Account, just send an email through the "contact us" menu item in the App with your request to delete your Account.

## Information Collected

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Personal Information (as defined herein) that CALA gathers when you are accessing the Site and/or the App and when you use any part of the Service. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners may share with us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that CALA does not own or control, nor to individuals that CALA does not employ or manage. You may register for an Account by providing certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) such as, and as applicable, your name, and your e-mail address. Any information that can readily identify a person is considered “Personal Information.” It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We will not be responsible for any problems or liability related to inaccurate or incomplete Personal Information, whether due to your failure to update such Personal Information or otherwise. In addition to the Personal Information, we may additionally collect the following information from Users (collectively with Personal Information, the “User Data”): (a) information from publicly accessible sources; (b) your visit to or use of the Site and Services, such as webpages viewed, links clicked and other similar navigation action in connection with the Site; and (c) certain standard browser information, such as your browser type, IP address, and access times.

In using and/or accessing the Services, you expressly authorize us to collect and use your User Data in connection with the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, maintain copies of your User Data indefinitely, or delete any or all User Data, at our sole discretion. When you receive promotional e-mails or newsletters from CALA, if any, we may use customized links or similar technologies to determine whether such newsletters or e-mail has been opened and which links you click. This information is used to provide you more focused e-mail communications and/or other information.

## Use of Information

CALA uses User Data to respond to your inquiries for additional information. We additionally collect and use User Data to operate and improve the Site and App and better deliver the Services. These uses may include performing analysis aimed at improving the Service; making the Site, App or Services more user friendly by reducing the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; and displaying content that are tailored to your preferences and interests.

## Sharing of Information

Currently, CALA will not share Personal Information with any third party for commercial purposes. You understand and agree that CALA may, however, disclose Personal Information if (a) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (b) authorized by you, (c) otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy or (d) CALA is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform or comply with applicable laws, regulations or legal process, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of CALA or any other user or (iii) enforce the Terms of Use. CALA may transfer personally identifiable information to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concern the Service.

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if CALA, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of CALA may continue to use your Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We may hire other companies to provide limited administrative and communication services on our behalf, such as hosting Sites, the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, or providing credit card processing services. We have the right to disclose your Personal Information to these third party companies for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site’s or App’s features, functions and operations. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only such Personal Information as necessary for them to deliver the respective services, and we do not authorize these companies to use your Personal Information except for the sole purpose of providing those services requested by CALA. We may also use your User Data to communicate with you, such as providing you with mandatory notices or discretionary notices about the Service. From time to time, we may also send you surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from CALA and its affiliates. We are headquartered in the United States of America. User Data may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States or to our affiliates, business partners, or service providers elsewhere in the world. By providing us with User Data, you consent to this transfer. We will protect the privacy and security of such information according to our Privacy Policy, regardless of where it is processed or stored.

For online payments, we may use the payment services provided by third-party service providers (the “Processor”)(e.g., Stripe, Bill.com, etc.). We do not process, record, or maintain your credit card or bank account information, and all of your information is stored securely on such Processor’s database. For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to the Processor’s terms of service and the Processor’s privacy policy. We may at times change our third-party payment processor. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such third-party payment processor.

## Security

Information collected by CALA is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, CALA cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you do so at your own risk. Once CALA receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on its systems.

## Third Party Sites

The Site or App may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site or App. These other websites are not under CALA control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the App are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and CALA is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

## IP Addresses and Cookies

CALA may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the App. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of the Site or App. "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Site and Service that depend on cookies.

## Opt-Out

If you change your mind about CALA use of User Data volunteered by you, you may CALA send an email to hi@ca.la with your electronic mail address.
