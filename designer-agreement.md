## 1. Production Services

(a) **General**. Through our technology platform (the "Platform"), which includes our proprietary software and content (the "Software") on our online website (including all content and functionality available through the https://ca.la/ domain name, the "Site"), we will provide you with the CALA services selected by you, including without limitation procuring and managing the procurement of Customer Service (as defined herein), Marketing (as defined herein) and Fulfillment (as defined herein) services in connection with your Subscription (as defined herein) and to connect you with our production and other partners ("Partners") for the provision of the foregoing and the production and financing of garments and/or accessories (collectively, the "Garments") in your design project ("Design Project") (such services, the "Services"). Our Partners can provide you with certain production services selected by you according to your Subscription, including, but not limited to, fabric manufacturing, trim vendors, technical designers, pattern makers, sourcing services, sample makers, packaging and/or production services (collectively, the "Production Services"). For avoidance of doubt, the specific Services and Production Services provided to you are dependent upon the subscription model selected by you, as more fully described on the subscription pricing page (the "Subscription Pricing Page") located at https://ca.la/access ("Subscription"), which, along with the selected Services, shall be set forth on the Customer Agreement or the Designer Services and Fees Agreement, as applicable, entered into in connection with this Agreement between you and CALA (either such agreement, the "Services and Fees Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein.

(b) **Production Services**. Once you design and submit a proposed Design Project through the Platform, we will review the Design Project to determine the estimated total costs of Production Services. You will then be given a quote (the "Quote") for all costs and fees (dependent upon your Subscription, including without limitation, costs and fees for any of pattern-making, material sourcing, prototypes, product development, custom labels, a sample for final approval, bulk units, a keep sample for CALA and packaging, but, for the avoidance of doubt, excluding Marketing Costs (as defined herein), Fulfillment Costs (as defined herein) and Customer Service Costs (defined herein)) required for the completion of your Design Project based on compatibility of your Design Project to an available Partner\'s Production Services. You understand and agree that (i) CALA, in its sole discretion, may match and connect you with a Partner based on the compatibility of the Production Services offered by such Partner to your Design Project; (ii) you agree to pay or finance the Quote prior to a Partner\'s commencement of Production Services; (iii) no Production Services will begin if your payment is declined (e.g., if your credit card is declined or financing is denied); (iv) prior to full production of the Garments of your Design Project, you agree to promptly review, approve and/or provide comments on any Garment sample (the "Sample") created by a Partner in connection with your Design Project; (v) if you make major changes, to be determined in our sole discretion, to a Sample, we may cancel the Design Project so it can be re-priced (for sake of example but not limitation, a major change may include changing the product type, changing major construction of a Garment by adding a hood or sleeve, changing the process type from print to embroidery or substantially changing materials (i.e., from denim to leather)); (vi) once you approve a Sample (an "Approved Sample") no changes of any kind can be made to a Garment or the Design Project; (vii) you cannot decrease the number of units, however you may be able to increase the number of units but up to the number of units included in the Approved Sample; (viii) you are solely responsible for payment of the Quote, any increase to the Quote and any additional costs incurred by us or a Partner and for any changes to the production and/or fulfillment schedule of the Garment or the Design Project due to changes made on your part to a previously-approved Sample; and (ix) there is no guarantee that CALA will be able to find a Partner to complete and fulfill your Design Project. All fees for Production Services shall be paid to CALA based on the Quote, pursuant to Section 3 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Quote (and all information used to create the Quote) is considered CALA Confidential Information (as defined herein) subject to all obligations and restrictions in Section 7 hereof, and Designer agrees not to discuss the Quote with any Partner. By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you expressly agree to the provisions of this Section 1 "Production Services".

(c) **Shipping and Delivery**. Designer understands and agrees that for the production and/or Fulfillment of Garments (the "Produced Garments") and dependent upon your Subscription, (i) Fulfillment Costs shall be handled by CALA and reimbursed by Designer as provided for in Section 3(f)(ii) hereof; (ii) you will provide accurate, truthful and up to date shipping information through the Platform for the delivery of Produced Garments; (iii) CALA or Partner may choose, in their sole discretion, to store any Produced Garments at a warehouse or other Fulfillment Partner; (iv) the method of shipping will be provided through a known courier or delivery service ("Courier") chosen by CALA or warehouse or other Fulfillment Partner; (v) if you choose to receive the Produced Garments, you agree to be present on the expected delivery date or designate an authorized adult to accept delivery of the Produced Garments; (vi) if you choose to receive the Produced Garments, you will inspect all Produced Garments immediately upon delivery and, if Produced Garments are damaged, defective, or otherwise incomplete (the "Damaged Garments"), you will have thirty (30) days from the delivery date (the "Notification Period") in which to notify and provide evidence to the Partner of such Damaged Garments, after which notification the Partner shall work with you to remedy the damage, defect, or incompletion (including without limitation, the cost to fix or replace the Damaged Garments) and return the Damaged Garments to Partner (if appropriate), all at Partner\'s cost and expense; (vii) if you choose to receive the Produced Garments, you will bear and be responsible for all shipping and delivery costs for the return of Damaged Garments to Partner if such damage is not reported to Partner within the Notification Period; (viii) CALA shall not be responsible for any damage caused by a warehouse or other Fulfillment Partner or Courier to the Produced Garments and your sole recourse will be against such warehouse or other Fulfillment Partner or Courier, as applicable, for such damage; (ix) you will direct all complaints in connection with any Damaged Garments to the warehouse or other Fulfillment Partner and not CALA; and (x) you will fully pay for all Produced Garments that meet the requirements and criteria of the Approved Sample.

## 2. Term; Termination

(a) **Term**. This Agreement shall commence on the date you first accept the terms herein and will continue in effect for the term set forth on your Services and Fees Agreement (the "Initial Term"). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive renewal terms of the same term as the Initial Term (each, a "Renewal Term" and together with the Initial Term, the "Term"), unless either Party gives the other Party notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable.

(b) **Termination for Cause**. This Agreement may be earlier terminated by either Party: (i) if the other Party materially breaches a provision of this Agreement, and fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) business days after receiving written notice of such breach from the non-breaching Party; or (ii) immediately upon written notice, if the other Party makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer is appointed to take charge of any or all of the other Party's property, or the other Party seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding or such a proceeding is instituted against the other Party and is not dismissed within ninety (90) days, or the other Party becomes insolvent or, without a successor, dissolves, liquidates or otherwise fails to operate in the ordinary course. If Designer is the terminating Party under the foregoing subsections (i) or (ii), CALA will refund to Designer any Fees that were pre-paid for the then current Term, pro-rated for the remainder thereof.

Sections 2 (Termination), 7 (Property Rights of the Parties), 12 (Non-Solicitation; Non-Circumvent), 9 (Indemnity) and 14 (Miscellaneous) will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

## 3. Fees; Financing

(a) **Subscription Fee**. You will pay CALA the non-cancelable and non-refundable subscription fee based on your Subscription ("Subscription Fee") for the Initial Term. At the end of the Initial Term, you will pay the then-current non-cancelable and non-refundable Subscription Fee set for on the Subscription Pricing Page for the Renewal Term, if any.

(b) **Revenue Share Fee**. If revenue sharing is part of your Subscription, you will pay CALA a Revenue (as defined herein) share fee for the percentage detailed in your Subscription ("Revenue Share Fee"). As used herein, the term "Revenue" means all income from the sales of the Garments. For avoidance of doubt, the Revenue Share Fee is used to calculate the percentage due CALA, whereas the amount due to you is the Revenue Share fee less costs, fees and other expenses. For sake of example but not limitation, if the Revenue is \$1,000, and CALA is entitled to twenty percent (20%), CALA shall be due \$200; however, you shall be due \$800 less the Quote (to the extent not already fully paid), the Marketing Costs, the Fulfillment Costs, and the Customer Service Costs.

(c) **Production Fee**. You will pay CALA the Quote for Production Services provided to you by a Partner, along with the Marketing Costs, Fulfillment Costs and Customer Service Costs described in Section 3(f) (collectively, "Production Fee"). You understand and hereby agree that dependent upon on your Subscription (i) payment or financing for one-hundred percent (100%) of the Quote shall be submitted by you up front prior to a Partner\'s commencement of Production Services; (ii) neither CALA nor Partner is required to release or deliver Produced Garments to you or any Fulfillment Partner if you fail to make full payment or financing of the Quote and (iii) Marketing Costs, Fulfillment Costs, and Customer Service Costs shall be deducted from Designer's percentage of Revenue as provided for in Section 3(f) hereof.

(d) **Financing**. If financing is part of your Subscription and you opt-in to financing, you understand and hereby agree that (i) you will promptly provide CALA your bank statements for the past three (3) months, and a direct connection into your bank account and full access to your e-commerce platform so CALA and/or Partner can review your sales history; (ii) CALA determines your credit limit and financing rate in its sole discretion; (iii) CALA can change your credit limit and financing rate in its sole discretion; (iv) our Fulfillment Partner will fulfill the Produced Garments; (v) your e-commerce store will process the sales of the Produced Garments; (vi) our Fulfillment Partner will be linked to your e-commerce store; (vii) the initial sales revenue will be deposited directly into your connected bank account via your e-commerce store and funds will be debited to pay down CALA's Revenue Share Fee, the Marketing Costs, Fulfillment Costs, Customer Service Costs, and your credit balance; (viii) you will be fully and completely responsible and liable to repay any and all amounts advanced to you by CALA; and (ix) in the event your credit debt is not paid in its entirety within four (4) months of checkout, CALA is allowed to use all means it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to collect the credit debt from you, including without limitation, changing the Revenue Share Fee, collection of Produced Garments and other means.

(e) **Access**. You will have access to available funds on the fifteenth (15th) day of the month for the previous month. You acknowledge and agree this delay is necessary to determine if Garments are returned and to resolve other issues.

(f) **Third Party Costs Included in Production Fee**. In the event CALA pays for any of the following third party costs, such costs are included in the Production Fee as provided for in Section 3(c) hereof:

  i. **Marketing Costs**: With respect to each Design Project CALA may set up paid marketing campaigns, creative and ads ("Marketing"), the authorization and cost of which ("Marketing Costs") shall be approved by Designer in advance of setup by CALA. Designer will pay for the costs of the Marketing (the "Marketing Costs") as they are deducted from Designer's percentage of the Revenue. For avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Costs will include a service fee to CALA, so that the actual amount spent on Marketing will be equal to the Marketing Costs minus such service fee. 

  ii. **Fulfillment Costs**: With respect to each Design Project, CALA will manage the procurement of fulfillment services from a Partner, including the warehousing, shipping and delivery of the Produced Garments ("Fulfillment"). Designer will pay for the costs of the Fulfillment (the "Fulfillment Costs") as they are deducted from Designer's percentage of the Revenue. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) the Fulfillment Costs will be calculated by weight and destination and (y) Fulfillment Costs change at least yearly based on pricing changes by the United States Post Office, FedEx, DHL UPS and other major carriers. 

  iii. **Customer Service Costs**: With respect to each Design Project, CALA may manage the procurement of customer service from a Partner, including the responses to customer inquiries, arranging for returns ("Customer Service"). Designer will pay for the costs of the Customer Service as specified on the Services and Fees Agreement (the "Customer Service Costs") as they are deducted from Designer's percentage of the Revenue. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer Service Costs will be calculated by number of customer service interactions.

For avoidance of doubt, the term "Fees" includes the Subscription Fee, the Revenue Share Fee and the Production Fee. **By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you expressly agree to the provisions of this Section 3 "Fees; Financing**".

## 4. CALA Deactivation Policy

CALA\'s goal is providing reliable and long lasting partnerships with Partners and contractors. CALA does this by connecting the top designers with the top Partners in terms of design, quality, reliability, accountability, and transparency in communication. This is only possible when designers trust Partners and vice versa. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have breached the terms of this Agreement and/or the Terms of Use, you may be barred or suspended from using the Platform, either temporarily or permanently, depending on the seriousness of the breach.

## 5. Compliance with the Law

You hereby acknowledge and agree that you will use the Services, Production Services, Site, Platform, and/or Software in full compliance at all times with all relevant state, federal and local laws, statutes, rules, ordinances, regulations, policies and other requirements.

## 6. Dispute Resolution

The parties agree that any controversy or dispute between the parties concerning this Agreement, including deactivation of Designer\'s access to the Platform or the construction or application of any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, will first be subject to reasonable good faith efforts by the parties to resolve such dispute, and if such good faith efforts are not successful, shall be submitted to binding arbitration in New York County, New York, on the request of any Party, and the arbitration shall comply with and be governed by the provisions of the New York Civil Practice Law & Rules, Article 75. Any cause of action or claim you may have with respect to this Agreement must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises. Arbitration shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators familiar with the commercial practices of CALA and Designer\'s industry. Each Party shall be entitled to select one (1) arbitrator, which two (2) selected arbitrators shall in turn select a third arbitrator. Any award or decision obtained from any such arbitration proceeding shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment upon any award thus obtained may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. All parties to the arbitration shall as an initial matter share the costs of such proceeding, but the prevailing Party may be awarded fees and costs, including reasonable attorney\'s fees. No action at law or in equity based upon any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be instituted in any court by either Party except (a) an action to compel arbitration pursuant to this Section 6, or (b) an action to enforce an award obtained in an arbitration proceeding in accordance with this Section 6.
