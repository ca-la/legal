## 1. Production Services

(a) **General**. Through our technology platform (the "Platform"), which includes our proprietary software and content (the "Software") on our online website (including all content and functionality available through the https://ca.la/ domain name, the "Site") and mobile application (the "App"), we will provide you with the CALA services selected by you according to your Subscription (as defined herein) (the "Services") in order to connect you with our production and other partners ("Partners") for the production, financing, marketing and/or fulfillment of garments and/or accessories (collectively, the "Garments") in your design project ("Design Project"). Our Partners can provide you with certain production services selected by you according to your Subscription, including, but not limited to, fabric manufacturing, trim vendors, technical designers, pattern makers, sourcing services, sample makers, packaging, marketing, production and/or fulfillment services (collectively, the "Production Services"). For avoidance of doubt, the specific Services and Production Services provided to you are dependent upon the subscription model selected by you, as more fully described on the subscription pricing page located at <https://ca.la/access> ("Subscription").

(b) **Production Services**. Once you design and submit a proposed Design Project through the Platform, we will review the Design Project to determine the estimated total costs of Production Services.  You will then be given a quote (the "Quote") for all costs and fees (dependent upon your Subscription, including without limitation, pattern-making, material sourcing, prototypes, product development, custom labels, a sample for final approval, bulk units, a keep sample for Company, packaging and marketing), required for the completion of your Design Project based on compatibility of your Design Project to an available Partner's Production Services.

All fees for Production Services shall be paid to Company based on the Quote, pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Quote (and all information used to create the Quote) is considered Company Confidential Information (as defined herein) subject to all obligations and restrictions in Section 7 hereof, and Contractor agrees not to discuss the Quote with any Partner. **By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you expressly agree to the provisions of this Section 1 "Production Services".**

## 2. Term; Termination

(a) **Term**. This Agreement shall commence on the date you first accept the terms herein and will continue in effect for the term of your Subscription period (the "Initial Term"). Following the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive renewal terms of the same term as the Initial Term (each, a "Renewal Term" and together with the Initial Term, the "Term"), unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then-current Renewal Term, as applicable.

(b) **Termination**. If either party materially breaches a provision of this Agreement, and fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) business days after receiving written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. If Contractor is the terminating party under the foregoing sentence, Company will refund to Contractor any Subscription Fee (as defined herein) that was pre-paid for the then current Term, pro-rated for the remainder thereof; and if Company is the terminating party under the foregoing sentence, Contractor is not entitled to a refund of any non-cancelable or non-refundable Subscription Fees. Company may, without prejudice to any right or remedy it may have under this Agreement, immediately terminate this Agreement for convenience, upon written notice to Contractor. In the event of termination by Company under the foregoing sentence, Company will refund to Contractor any Subscription Fee that was pre-paid for the then current Term, pro-rated for the remainder thereof. For any termination of this Agreement, Company shall be entitled to payment for Services and Production Services performed and expenses paid or incurred prior to the effective date of termination, including without limitation, any Revenue Share Fee or Production Fee. Upon termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall promptly return any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. All terms and conditions of this Agreement, by their sense and content, are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, shall survive, regardless of the reason of such expiration or termination.

## 3.Â Fees; Financing

(a) **Subscription Fee**. You will pay Company the non-cancelable and non-refundable subscription fee based on your Subscription ("Subscription Fee") for the Initial Term.

(b) **Revenue Share Fee**. If revenue sharing is part of your Subscription, you will pay Company a Revenue (as defined herein) share fee for the percentage detailed in your Subscription ("Revenue Share Fee"). As used herein, the term "Revenue" means all income from the sales of the Garments. For avoidance of doubt, the Revenue Share Fee is used to calculate the percentage due Company, whereas the amount due to you is the Revenue Share fee less costs, fees and other expenses. For sake of example but not limitation, if the Revenue is $1,000, and Company is entitled to fifteen percent (15%), Company shall be due $150; however, you shall be due $850 less the costs of production and fulfillment.

(c) **Production Fee**. You will pay Company the Quote, for Production Services provided to you by a Partner and other fees associated with the costs of goods, fulfillment and/or marketing (collectively, "Production Fee"). For avoidance of doubt, the costs of goods and fulfillment **are not** included in the Subscription Fee or Revenue Share Fee, and will be quoted within the Platform based on design complexity and number of units. You understand and hereby agree that dependent upon on your Subscription (i) payment or financing for one-hundred percent (100%) of the Quote shall be submitted by you up front prior to a Partner's commencement of Production Services; and (ii) neither Company nor Partner is required to release or deliver Produced Garments to you or any fulfillment Partner if you fail to make full payment or financing of the Quote.

(d) **Financing**. If financing is part of your Subscription and you opt-in to financing, you understand and hereby agree that (i) you will promptly provide Company your bank statements for the past three (3) months, or a direct connection into your bank account and full access to your e-commerce platform so Company and/or Partner can review your sales history; (ii) Company determines your credit limit and financing rate in its sole discretion; (iii) Company can change your credit limit and financing rate in its sole discretion; (iv) our fulfillment Partner will fulfill the Produced Garments; (v) your e-commerce store will process the sales of the Produced Garments; (vi) our fulfillment Partner will be linked to your e-commerce store; (vii) the initial sales revenue, less the cost of fulfillment, will be deposited directly into a Company account via your e-commerce store to pay down your credit balance; (viii) the Revenue Share Fee will be used to pay down your credit balance until such balance is zero; (vix) you will be fully and completely responsible and liable to repay any and all amounts advanced to you by Company; and (vx) in the event you do not timely pay down your credit debt, Company is allowed to use all means it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to collect the credit debt from you, including without limitation, changing the Revenue Share Fee, collection of Produced Garments and other means.

(e) **Access**. You will have access to available funds on the fifteenth (15^th^) day of the month for the previous month. You acknowledge and agree this delay is necessary to determine if Garments are returned and to resolve other issues.

For avoidance of doubt, the term "Fees" includes the Subscription Fee, the Revenue Share Fee and the Production Fee. **By accepting the terms of this Agreement, you expressly agree to the provisions of this Section 3 "Fees".**
