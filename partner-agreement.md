  - (i)  production partners (each a “**Production Partner**”) who provide production services (including fabric manufacturing, trim vendors and sample making and production of garments) with respect to orders of garments and/or accessories (collectively, the “**Garments**”) by Designers (each such order of Garments, a “**Design Project**”);

  - (ii)  access to consultants (technical designers, pattern makers and other sourcing services) in connection with the production of Garments in any given Design Project (the services described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “**Production Services**”); and

  - (iii)  design partners (each a “**Design Partner**”) who provide Designers with branding design, graphic design, ghost design, technical design, pattern design (collectively, the “**Design Services**”) in connection with the production of Garments in a Design Project.

  - (the services described in clauses (i)-(iii), collectively, the “**Partner Services"**).

(b)  Production Services.

  - (i)  Once a Designer submits a proposed Design Project through the Platform, in accordance with the applicable agreement between the Designer and Company (the “**Designer Agreement**”), Company shall, following review of such Design Project, connect the Designer with the appropriate Production Partner, in Company’s sole discretion (the “**Production Partner Selection Process**”). For the avoidance of doubt, there is no guarantee that Production Partner will be matched with a Designer in any Production Partner Selection Process.

  - (ii)  Following the Production Partner Selection Process, Company, in its sole discretion, shall assign a monetary value to all costs and fees (including without limitation, pattern-making, material sourcing, prototypes, product development, custom labels, a salesman sample for final approval, bulk units, and a keep sample for Company), required for the fulfilment of the Production Services for each Design Project submitted through the Platform (the “**Bid**”) and shall send each completed Bid to the Production Partner identified in the Production Partner Selection Process. Within seventy-two (72) hours of submission by the Company of the Bid, the Production Partner shall accept or reject the Bid in whole and not in part. Upon acceptance of a Bid (the “**Accepted Bid**”) by the applicable Production Partner (the “**Accepting Production Partner**”), such Production Partner shall be bound to provide the Production Services at costs and fees that shall not exceed the costs and fees set forth in the Accepted Bid. The Accepted Bid shall be final in respect of the applicable Design Project. In the event the Production Partner rejects the Bid, Company shall repeat the procedures found this *Section 1(b)(ii)* until an Accepting Production Partner is found.

  - (iii)  Following an Accepted Bid, Designer will, in accordance with its Designer Agreement, provide clear instructions and timeline to Accepting Production Partner, via the Platform, regarding the production of Garments in the applicable Design Project. The Platform shall be the sole, binding method of communication between the Accepting Production Partner and Designer. For the avoidance of doubt, approval, rejection and/or comments to a Sample (defined below) or other inquiries or questions shall be provided through the Platform. Sample approval via the Platform shall be final, irrevocable and definitive for all purposes under this Agreement.

  - (iv)  At the direction of Designer via the Platform, Accepting Production Partner will commence Production Services by first providing the number and type of samples required by the applicable Design Project, as determined by Company in its sole discretion (the “**Samples**”), to Designer with respect to each garment in the Design Project. Designer, in accordance with the Designer Agreement, shall review, approve and/or provide comments on any Sample created by an Accepting Production Partner in connection with such Design Project.

  - (v)  If Designer requests a major and substantial change to a Sample (a “**Major Alteration**”) that materially impacts the production time, the pricing or other material term contained in the Accepted Bid, as determined in Company’s sole discretion, Company may place on hold or otherwise cancel the Accepted Bid and a new Bid shall be issued in accordance with *Section 1(b)(ii)*, first to the Accepting Production Partner to be accepted or rejected by such Accepting Production Partner within seventy-two (72) hours. In the event the Accepting Production Partner rejects the new Bid or does not respond within seventy-two (72) hours, Company shall offer the Bid to other Production Partners identified in the Production Partner Selection Process as described in *Section 1(b)(i)*. By way of illustration and without limitation, a Major Alteration may include change of the product type, change of construction of a Garment by adding a hood or sleeve or other feature, change in the process type from print to embroidery or substantially changing materials (i.e., from denim to leather).

  - (vi)  Once a Designer approves the final Sample (the “**Top of Production Sample**”), no changes of any kind (whether material or immaterial) may be made to a Garment nor to the number of units for a given Garment in connection with the applicable Design Project. Following approval of the Top of Production Sample, Accepting Production Partner shall promptly commence full production of the applicable Garment pursuant to the applicable Design Project. Provided that the Designer does not instruct Accepting Production Partner to deviate from the Top of Production Sample, Accepting Production Partner will be responsible for replacing production of Garments and all costs associated with such reproduction in the event the completed Garments deviate from or do not conform to the Top of Production Sample.

  - (vii)  All fees for Production Services shall be paid to Accepting Production Partner based on the Bid, pursuant to *Section 1(b)(ii)*. For the avoidance of doubt, the Bid (and all information used to create the Bid) is considered Company Confidential Information subject to all obligations and restrictions in *Section 8*, and Production Partner agrees to discuss neither the Bid nor Accepted Bid at any time with the Designer.

(c)  Design Services

  - (i)  Following Company’s review of each Design Project submitted through the Platform, in accordance with the Designer Agreement, Company shall, following review of such Designer Project, connect Designer with the appropriate Production Partner (the “**Design Partner Selection Process**”). For the avoidance of doubt, there is no guarantee that Production Partner will be matched with a Designer in any Design Partner Selection Process.

  - (ii)  Following the Design Partner Selection Process, Company, in its sole discretion, shall assign a monetary value to all costs and fees for the Design Services, required for the fulfillment of each Design Project submitted through the Platform (the “**Offer**”) and shall send each completed Offer to the Design Partner identified in the Design Partner Selection Process. Within seventy-two (72) hours of submission by the Company of the Offer, the Design Partner shall accept or reject the Offer in whole and not in part. Upon acceptance of an Offer (the “**Accepted Offer**”) by the applicable Design Partner (the “**Accepting Design Partner**”) such Design Partner shall be bound to provide the Design Services at costs and fees that shall not exceed the costs and fees set forth in the Accepted Offer. The Accepted Offer will be final in respect of the applicable Design Project. In the event the Design Partner rejects the Offer, Company shall repeat the procedures found in this *Section 1(c)(ii)* until an Accepting Design Partner is found.

  - (iii)  Following the Accepted Offer, Designer will, in accordance with the Designer Agreement, provide clear instructions to Accepting Design Partner, via the Platform, for the performance of the Design Services for the applicable Design Project. In compliance with Designer’s clear instructions, Accepting Design Partner and Company shall formulate a mutually agreed upon plan regarding the timeline, goals and requirements regarding the Design Services for each applicable Design Project  prior to the performance of the Design Services (the “**Plan**”). The Platform shall be the sole, binding method of communication between the Accepting Design Partner and Designer.

  - (iv)  Following the formulation of the Plan, Designer shall direct the Accepting Design Partner to initiate performance of the Design Services. Promptly upon receiving such direction, Accepting Design Partner shall commence the Design Services. With the exception of changes to the Plan or Design Services in regard to ghost design services (“**Ghost Design Services**”), no changes may be requested by Designer to the Plan or Design Services in connection with the applicable Design Project following commencement of the Designer Services. In the case of changes requested by Designer to Ghost Design Services (“**Ghost Design Changes**”), such change requests shall be submitted via the Platform. The Company may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of Ghost Design Changes the Designer may make to each applicable Design Project. All costs resulting from Ghost Design Changes shall be charged to Designer by Company on behalf of the Ghost Design Partner. Provided that the Designer does not instruct Accepting Design Partner to deviate from the Plan, Accepting Design Partner will be responsible for any deviation from the Plan and any costs associated therewith.

  - (v)  All fees for the Design Services shall be paid to Accepting Design Partner based on the Offer, pursuant to *Section 1(c)(ii)*. For the avoidance of doubt, the Offer (and all information used to create the Offer) is considered Company Confidential Information subject to all obligations and restrictions in *Section 8*, and Design Partner agrees not to discuss the Offer or the Accepted Offer with the Designer.
